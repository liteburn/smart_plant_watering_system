# Smart plant watering system - a project for Principles of Computer Organization
## Short documentation about project's goals and materials used in this project

## Should do the following:
- Measure moisture of soil in the pot and output data to the board
- Read data from the soil capacitor and decide when to turn on the water pump
- Check the moisture with certain frequency and keep the soil wet
- Be able to view all information from smartphone
- Be able to choose mode and frequency of watering from smartphone
- Output current mode and moisture level on the screen
- Transfer information to the server using a Wi-Fi module
- Implement proper lighting to keep the plants in 

## Materials used for the project:
- STM32F411EDISCOVERY
